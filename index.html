      <h2>Life is too short and the web is too big for jargon, buzzwords and nonsense. Let's just get it&nbsp;done.</h2>
    
        <p>Front End development frameworks, a robust Content Management System, knowledge in multiple programming &amp; markup languages, some Graphic Design and a fair bit of common sense are the tools of a web developer in 2016.</p>
    
        <p>I create modern websites that are easy to use and get to the point. People like that when they want to find your contact details or locate the checkout button.</p>
    
        <p>With over 15 years in the Web Design and Development industry, I know a thing or two about how to create successful websites for people.</p>

        <p>As of February 2016, I am looking for full time employment.</p> 
        <p>I work fast and efficiently, using modern web development techniques and technologies. I am open to speaking about working remotly and freelence projects.</p>

      <h3>Do what you love.</h3>
    
        <p>I enjoy working with people that love what they do.</p>
    
        <p>It's easy to get excited when people are passionate about their work. If we're both excited by what you do and how you do it, great things will happen.</p>

          <p>Scott single handedly developed my e-commerce website by the highest standards for luxury goods. We owe countless positive client reviews of seamless shopping experiences to him and an extremely reliable site to his skills. He’s lovely to work with, will always 'say it like it is' and is super efficient with his work, making sure you stick to your deadlines and get things done! We continue to work with Scott on new developments and improvements for our website. We wouldn't let anyone else touch our site!</p>

        <p>I have a varied skill set. From Front End Development - SASS &amp; CSS, HTML, jQuery &amp; Javascript. Full Content Management builds using <a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft CMS</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify's</a> Liquid templates. Usability, Information Architecture, Graphic Design and web typography.</p> 
    
        <p>I'm skilled at interpreting design for the web, preferring to work with a designer on iterative style guides and developing design elements, instead of just creating a copy of fully finished Photoshop files.</p>

      <h4>"Can I see a portfolio of your work?"</h4>
    
        <p>These are some of the latest sites I've worked on.</p> 
        <p>This is a mix of both freelance and within employment at <a href="http://www.mearns-gill.com">Mearns &amp; Gill</a>, where much of my work has been completed in the last three years.</p>

        <p>While talking about a potential job or project with you, I can give you more links to my previous work. I'll also give an idea of why it is relevant. This context is important. Not every project is the same and neither is every website.</p>
    
        <p>Here are some types of clients that I've worked with before, or would love to work with. Bonus points if this is you:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Craft beer or spirits</li>
          <li>Photographers, models</li>
          <li>Tattooers &amp; piercers</li>
          <li>Lingerie brands or retailers</li>
          <li>Publishing - books &amp; magazines</li>
          <li>Musicians or bands</li>
          <li>3D &amp; motion graphics</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h5>Let's talk about money.</h5>
    
      <p>Actually, let’s not. It's too early in this relationship to do that.</p> 
    
      <p>We can work that out later when we have spoken in more detail and come up with a number that suits us both.</p>
