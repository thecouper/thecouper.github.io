                <p>I work efficiently, using modern web development techniques and technologies. With over 18 years experience in the Web Design and Development industry, I know a thing or two about how to create successful&nbsp;websites.</p>

                <p>I am available for hire - remotely or on location. I can work solo on projects, or as part of your extended team. For details about my experience and what I can bring to the party, phone 07446&nbsp;659119 or use any of those great big buttons to email&nbsp;me.</p>
                <p>I could also mention how I am a Dad, an enthusiastic amateur cook with a questionable taste in 1980's comedy films and how own I more Lego than I know where to put - that's what people put on their CV, right?</p>
