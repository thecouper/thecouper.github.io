                <p>Are you looking for a skilled web developer who will get to the point and likes to build good things that work properly?</p>
                <p>I am available for hire - remotely or on location. I can work solo on projects, or as part of your extended team. For details about my experience and what I can bring to the party, phone 07446&nbsp;659119 or use any of those great big buttons to email&nbsp;me.</p>
                <p>I could also mention how I am a Dad, an enthusiastic amateur cook with a questionable taste in 1980's comedy films and how own I more Lego than I know where to put - that's what people put on their CV, right?</p>

                  <p>Scott is always professional and thorough with web development. He cares about the standard of work he produces and he will always ask the right questions to get to the heart of the matter. I have no hesitation in recommending him.</p>

                  <p>Scott single handedly developed my e-commerce website by the highest standards for luxury goods. We owe countless positive client reviews of seamless shopping experiences to him and an extremely reliable site to his skills. He’s lovely to work with, will always 'say it like it is' and is super efficient with his work, making sure you stick to your deadlines and get things done! We continue to work with Scott on new developments and improvements for our website. We wouldn't let anyone else touch our&nbsp;site!</p>
